        </div>
        <div class="col-12">
            <p class="p-4">Along with its top manufacturer partners, Apex Technologies USA is proud to announce the creation of a high
                level iRacing Virtual Sim Road Racing Team. Apex Tech Racing will compete in the top Road Racing Prototype and
                GT leagues, events and series on the iRacing platform. With a roster of accomplished iRacing road racers hailing
                from across the United States, Apex Tech Racing will compete in the newly formed NASA GT Americas presented
                By Spark GTE Series in the Chevrolet C8R Corvette, the Virtual Endurance Championship in the Dallara P217 LMP2
                Prototype, iRacing Special Endurance Events in multiple cars and many individual endurance races and charity
                events over the 2020 and 2021 iRacing seasons. </p>
            <p class="pb-4 px-4">Founded during the height of the COVID pandemic by Apex Technologies CEO and first Apex Tech Racing Team
                Principal Ryan Donaher who was able to reach out to like minded sim racers he was competing with on a daily
                and weekly basis to put this group of veteran racers together. He explains “I decided early on if we were going to
                do this, we were going to do it right. Our most important tenet on this team is to have fun. If we can compete
                with the best sim racers while having fun, then that is a win for us.” But make no mistake Donaher and the rest of
                team expects to battle and collect checkered flags. He continues “We intend to win. Compete and win. Period.
                Our drivers and our sponsors expect nothing less.”</p>
            <p class="pb-4 px-4">And speaking of sponsors, Apex Technologies USA is uniquely positioned to partner with the best in class
                technology manufacturers and brands it represents in the United States to make this team even stronger. Primary
                sponsor All In Sports (AIS)- the leading racing simulator manufacturer led by race winning Formula 1 Race
                Engineers- is thrilled to be a part of the team. As AIS owner and previous head of Ferrari F1 Simulator Department
                Anton Stipinovich relates “We have been building the best racing simulators in the world for more than a decade
                and a half. Every day we use technology we developed in Formula 1 to offer our clients the best virtual racing
                experiences available anywhere. With Apex Technologies firmly representing and growing our footprint in the
                United States, it was natural for us to be involved with the new sim racing team. Top Formula 1 drivers like
                Fernando Alonso and Charles Leclerc use our simulators and race with AIS logos proudly displayed on their virtual
                cars. Rest assured the guys on Apex Tech Racing are backed by the best in the business.”
                </p>
            <p class="pb-4 px-4">With associate sponsors Meridian Audio and TPI Cinema also fully supporting the team and its drivers Apex Tech
                Racing is poised to make a huge splash on the iRacing platform. Donaher exclaims “We are extremely lucky to
                have such like minded business partners. They firmly believe in this race team and who knows- maybe someday
                we can go from virtual to real life racing with the same crew of sponsors and drivers?”
